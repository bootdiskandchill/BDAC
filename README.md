The official archive of BOOT DISK AND CHILL a creative lab and cultural archive at the intersection of obsolete tech, underground sound, and independent publishing.

BDAC is an ongoing public drop of digital ephemera: sample packs, articles, hardware guides, field notes, and custom tools for producers, hackers, and curious minds. 

Everything here is designed to be compiled into an annual release.

If you love beats, floppies, old MPCs, late-night sound design, or the philosophy of doing more with less — welcome, beat punks.
