The official archive of **BOOT DISK AND CHILL**, a creative lab and cultural archive at the intersection of obsolete tech, underground sound, and independent publishing.

BDAC is an ongoing public drop of digital ephemera: sample packs, articles, hardware guides, field notes, and custom tools for producers, hackers, and curious minds.  
Everything here is designed to be compiled into an **annual release**.

If you love beats, floppies, old MPCs, late-night sound design, or the philosophy of doing more with less — welcome, beat punks.
